Make the data in the column consistent within itself.

**TO DO** insert example of inconsistent data, then show uniform data

## Format columns for consistency

**TO DO ** revise to show example of an inconsistent column, and how reformatting makes consistent

If your data needs to be formatted, select a spreadsheet column by clicking at the top. Or select the entire spreadsheet by clicking the top-left corner icon. Right-click your selection to reformat data (or use menu commands). For example, reformat the data to change the number of decimal points displayed. Or reformat a zip code from a number (because 06106 will not display the first zero) into a text or zip code field.
