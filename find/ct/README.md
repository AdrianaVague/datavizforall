**Connecticut State Data Center** (http://ctsdc.uconn.edu/), part of the U.S. Census Data Center Network, is the lead agency for US Census data and other socioeconomic data for Connecticut, and is based at the University of Connecticut Libraries. The site also features data visualizations created on the Tableau platform and provides population projections for the state of Connecticut.
