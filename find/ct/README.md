# Connecticut open data

Since this book was created in Hartford, Connecticut, it lists state and municipal open data repositories for the benefit of local readers:

**Connecticut Open Data** (http://data.ct.gov), the official portal for state government agencies, is hosted on the Socrata platform, which offers built-in data visualization tools and APIs. See also separate repositories for individual state agencies:
- Office of the State Comptroller (http://www.osc.ct.gov/openCT.html)
- CT State Department of Education (http://www.sde.ct.gov/sde/cwp/view.asp?a=2758&q=334520)
- Office of Policy and Management (http://ct.gov/opm/cwp/view.asp?a=3006&Q=383258&opmNav_GID=1386)
- link to all CT state government agencies (http://portal.ct.gov/Department-and-Agencies/)

**Connecticut State Data Center** (http://ctsdc.uconn.edu/), part of the U.S. Census Data Center Network, is the lead agency for US Census data and other socioeconomic data for Connecticut, and is based at the University of Connecticut Libraries. The site also features data visualizations created on the Tableau platform and provides population projections for the state of Connecticut.

**MAGIC: The Map and Geographic Information Center** (http://magic.lib.uconn.edu), based at the University of Connecticut Libraries, specializes in providing geographic, aerial photography, and map images for the state, past and present. The site also features interactive maps.

**DataHaven** (http://ctdatahaven.org/), a non-profit organization, collects and interprets information about Connecticut neighborhoods, such as its Community Wellbeing Survey. Data resources feature neighborhood profiles for densely-populated areas (New Haven and Hartford-West Hartford), and town profiles for other areas across the state.

**Connecticut Data Collaborative** (http://ctdata.org) is a public-private partnership that advocates for open data access to drive planning, policy, budgeting and decision making in Connecticut at the state, regional and local levels. We democratize public data through custom data exploration tools and a dynamic town profile tool, hosted on the open-source CKAN platform. Users can find state and federal data on topics such as public health, education, crime, municipal data, and racial profiling data.

**Hartford Data** (http://data.hartford.gov), the official portal of the City of Hartford municipal government, is hosted on the Socrata platform, which features built-in visualizations and APIs. Also, the site links to the City's ArcGIS Online geographic data (http://gisdata.hartford.gov/) and the City's financial data (http://checkbook.hartford.gov/).
