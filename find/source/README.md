# Source Your Data Files

Source your data. Spell out exactly where it came from, so that someone other than you, several years in the future, could understand its origin.

## Label the file name

Everyone has seen examples of bad file names:
  - data.xls
  - bldgdatalist.csv
  - data77.xls

Write a short but meaningful file name. If different versions of the data are floating around, add the current date at the end, in YYYY-MM-DD format, perhaps like this:
  - town-demographics-2016-03-08.xls

## Save source data in separate sheet

If you have doubts when cleaning up columns, click (or right-click) on the spreadsheet tab to copy the sheet to another tab as a backup, to avoid destroying any data.

Add a *source* tab, after the data, with notes to remind you and others about its origins and when it was last updated.
