# Make a Second Copy of a GitHub Repo

**TO DO**

Problem: GitHub only allows you to create **one fork** of a code repository. How do you create a second copy?

Two solutions:

1) Browser solution:
- download repo as zip file to your computer
- uncompress (or unzip) the contents of the repo on your computer
- in your GitHub browser, create a new repo with a new name
- in your new GitHub repo, click Upload files, and drag-and-drop contents from one repo into your new repo. Scroll down to click the Commit button to save your edits
- in your new GitHub repo, remember to click Settings > GitHub Pages > select Master branch > Save. Scroll down again to copy the link to your published web page. Click the repo name to return to the main page, open and edit the README.md file, and insert the link to your new published web page here.

2) GitHub Desktop solution (for Mac or Windows) -- in this book, see chapter [Efficiently Edit Code with GitHub Desktop and Atom Editor](../desktop-atom)
