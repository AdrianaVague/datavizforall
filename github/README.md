# Share, Edit, and Host Code Templates with GitHub
*by [Jack Dougherty, Stacy Lam, and David Tatem](../introduction/who.md), last updated March 5, 2017*

In the first half of this book, we explored free web services that offer easy drag-and-drop tools to create interactive charts and maps, such as Google Sheets, Google My Maps, BatchGeo, Carto, and Tableau Public. But these web services have limited options for designing and customizing your visualizations, and also make you dependent on their web servers to host your work.

In this second half of the book, we'll explore how to use code templates, meaning pre-written software instructions, to create and customize a wider range of visualizations. With many of these templates, you only need to learn how to make simple edits to insert your data, customize its appearance, and display it on the web on a site you control. We will share, edit, and host our templates using a free web service called GitHub (http://github.com). Although advanced coders use more powerful versions of this tool, this chapter is designed for beginners, and we can accomplish all of the steps in your web browser.

In this chapter, you will learn how to:
- [Fork, host, and edit a simple Leaflet point map template with GitHub](fork-leaflet)
- [Fork, host, and edit a simple Highcharts template with GitHub](fork-highcharts)
- [Efficiently edit code with GitHub Desktop and Atom Editor](desktop-atom)
