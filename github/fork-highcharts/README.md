# Fork and Edit a Highcharts Scatter Chart with GitHub
*By [Jack Dougherty](../../introduction/who.md), last updated March 14, 2017*

This tutorial introduces the **basic steps** of working with code templates, using a simple Highcharts scatter chart code (http://highcharts.com) and GitHub in your browser (http://github.com). You will learn how to:
- Fork (or copy) the Highcharts scatter chart template to your GitHub account
- Publish your live chart to the public web with the GitHub Pages feature
- Modify the chart title, labels, and upload new data points from a CSV spreadsheet

Code templates help us to move beyond the limits of drag-and-drop web tools (such as Google Sheets and Tableau Public) and to create more customized visualizations on a web server that you control. Before you begin, learn the broad concepts in the chapter introduction [Modify and Host Code Templates with GitHub](../github). For more advanced examples, see the [Highcharts Templates](../highcharts) chapter in this book.
