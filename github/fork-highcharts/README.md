Advantages:
- more control to customize and host data visualizations on any web server
- no usage fee for non-commercial use….see below
Disadvantage: dependent on Highcharts code library

Also, note that Highcharts is open-source code, and free for individual, school, and non-profit use.
If commercial use, then you’ll need to purchase a license

Upload a NEW data.csv file, in the proper format for your Highcharts visualization, into your GitHub account. Feel free to download this sample data (ct school districts…), which you will need to modify slightly to match the proper format. Or use your own data.

Insert a proper title, labels, source info. . .
