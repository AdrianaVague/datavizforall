# Fix Common Code and GitHub Errors

What happens if your code breaks and no longer displays what it was designed to show? This is a very common problem, especially for newer students, because accidentally erasing a single character (even a semicolon) can make your visualization disappear from the published website. But breaking your code -- and figuring out how to fix it -- is a great way to learn, even if it requires trial and error.
