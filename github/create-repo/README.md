*By [Jack Dougherty](../../introduction/who.md), last updated March 11, 2017*

Question: If I already forked one copy of a code repository on GitHub, it will not allow me to fork it a second time. So how can I make a second copy of a repo?

Answer: Create a new repository on GitHub, download open-source code from an existing repo, and upload it to your new repo. This tutorial demonstrates these steps using any web browser on a computer (such as Mac, Windows, or Chromebook).
