# Fork, Host, and Edit a Simple Leaflet Point Map Template with GitHub
*By [Jack Dougherty](../../introduction/who.md), last updated March 5, 2017*

This tutorial shows how to fork (copy), host, and edit a very simple point map, created with the open-source Leaflet code library (http://leafletjs.com), using GitHub (http://github.com) in your browser.

This basic tutorial teaches only the first steps of hosting and editing code templates. The goal is to help you move beyond the limitations of drag-and-drop web mapping services (such as BatchGeo and Google MyMaps), to create more customized maps on a web server that you control. To learn more, see additional [Leaflet Map Templates](../leaflet) in this book.

## Tool Review
GitHub (http://github.com) is a versatile tool to share, edit, and host simple code templates on the public web. Requires a free account. See also the previous chapter in this book on [Creating Simple Web Pages with GitHub Pages](../embed/github-pages).
- Pros:
  - Free and easy-to-learn tool to share, edit, and host simple code templates.
  - All steps below can be completed in your web browser.
- Cons:
  - All work on GitHub is public by default. Private repositories (folders) require payment.
  - New users sometimes confuse the links for code repositories versus published web pages.

## Try it
You will copy and edit a very simple interactive point map like the one below:

1) Right-click to open this GitHub code template in a new tab: https://github.com/JackDougherty/leaflet-map-simple

2) Sign in to your free GitHub account

3) In the upper-right corner, click Fork to copy the template (also called a code repository, or repo) into your own account. Important: You can only fork a GitHub repo **one time**. To make a second copy, see chapter **TO DO**

4) In your new copy of the code repo, click on Settings, scroll down to the GitHub Pages area, select Master, and Save. This publishes the code to a public website that you control.

5) Scroll down to GitHub Pages section again, to select and copy the link to your published web site.

6) Scroll up to the top, and click on your repo name to go back to its main page.

7) At the top level of your repo main page, click on README.md, and click the pencil icon to edit this file, written in easy-to-read Markdown code.

8) Delete the existing link to my live site, and paste in the link to your site. Scroll down and Commit to save your edits.

9) On your repo main page, right-click on the link to your published site to open in a new tab. **Be patient ** because during busy periods, your website may take up to 1 minute to appear the first time.

10) Go back to your browser tab for your code repo. Click on the index.html file (which contains the map code), and click the pencil icon to edit it.

11) Explore the map code, which contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Look for code comments that begin with "EDIT" for ideas about what you can easily change. Scroll down to Commit your changes.

12) Go to your live website browser tab and refresh the page to view your edits. **Be patient* during busy periods, when some edits may take up to 1 minute to appear.
