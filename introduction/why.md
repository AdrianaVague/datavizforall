# Why This Book?

The goal of this book is to democratize the power of data visualization and make it more accessible for all. Over the past several years, my undergraduate students and I have been creating interactive charts and maps to improve our ability to tell data-driven stories on the web. In addition to our academic work, we have also partnered on projects with journalists, government agencies, and non-profit organizations. Tools that were once costly are now freely available on the web, and easier to learn, if you have some guidance on key concepts and step-by-step support. This book-in-progress outlines what we have learned, and seeks to freely share our knowledge with others. Explore our examples, follow the tutorials, and learn how to tell your story **and** show the data.
