** TO DO **

- Distinguish infographics from data visualizations
- Show examples of interactive charts and maps in this book

## Exploration versus Explanation
- define both
- data visualization can be used for both, but this book emphasizes explanation, in the form of a story

## Paper vs. Presentations vs. Public Web
- How do you envision your audiences will see your data visualizations? Most books assume that your work will be delivered to readers in one of these formats:
  - printed paper that you hand out to readers in person at a meeting
  - static PDF file that readers receive via email or download
  - presentation slides that you deliver to a live audiences
- But this book

## Storytelling with Data and Narrative
- Data visualization is more than pretty pictures. Instead, the best visualizations are those that tell a story -- and draw your attention to what really matters -- through the combination of images and text.
