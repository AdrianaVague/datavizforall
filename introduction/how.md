# How to Read and Comment
*by [Jack Dougherty](introduction/who.md), last updated February 28, 2017*

*Data Visualization for All* refers to both this open-access digital book and a [free online course](../enroll) by the same name. We refer to them as "the book" and "the course."

## Recommended: Read the online edition
We designed the book to be read online, in any modern web browser, on desktops, laptops, or mobile devices. The online edition features interactive charts and maps that you can explore, and video tutorials that you can view at your own pace. If desired, readers can freely download any of the ebook editions--[PDF](https://www.gitbook.com/download/pdf/book/jackdougherty/datavizforall) or [ePUB](https://www.gitbook.com/download/epub/book/jackdougherty/datavizforall) or [Mobi/Kindle](https://www.gitbook.com/download/mobi/book/jackdougherty/datavizforall)--but these do not include the interactive features in the online web edition. Learn more about [how GitBook works](../gitbook) and publish your own book.

## Open links in new tabs
Keep your place when reading online and moving between pages.  
- Two-finger trackpad click
- or Control + click (Mac)
- or Alt + click (Chromebook)
- or right-click (Windows and others)

## Use a second monitor
If you have a small screen, consider connecting a second monitor, or work next to a second computer or tablet. This allows you to view tutorials in one screen and build visualizations in the other screen.
