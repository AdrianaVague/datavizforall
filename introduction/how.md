# How to Read and Comment on this book

**TO DO**
add conceptual and logistical recommendations about reading and commenting on this online book

- We designed this book to be read online, in your web browser, for free.
- the web edition features interactive charts and maps that you can explore in your browser, just like the kinds we teach you how to create inside this book
- If you prefer, you also can freely download a PDF edition to print out, or an eBook edition to read on your Kindle or similar device, add links
- But the online web edition is preferable, because the downloadable PDF and eBook editions do not include several graphics that only appear online.

- When reading online, learn how to open links in new tabs, to help keep your place when moving between different pages.
  - Open links in new tabs:
    - Mac: two-finger trackpad click, or Control + click   
	  - Windows: ?????
    - Chrome: two-finger trackpad click, or Alt + click

    - - hard refresh (how to do it on different browsers)
- capture screenshot (how to on different operating systems)

- raise up text and visuals from gitbook improve.md section

- note that headers and lists cannot accept GitBook comments
