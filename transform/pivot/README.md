# Pivot Address-Level Point Data into Polygon Data
*By [Jack Dougherty](../../introduction/who.md), last updated March 26, 2017*

** TO DO **
- problem: start with address-level point map data, but desire polygon map
- one solution: split columns of address data, pivot table into polygon regions, normalize data (next chapter)
- related solution: US Census Geocoder -- convert addresses into census tracts, etc. -- then pivot
- other solution: spatial join with mapshaper.org
