# Transform Your Data

This section demonstrates ways to restructure your spreadsheet data and make it more meaningful for your data visualization. For example, you may wish to:

- Aggregate (or group together) rows of data with similar entries
- Join together data from two tables that share a similar column
- Geocode (or locate the map coordinates) of street address data
