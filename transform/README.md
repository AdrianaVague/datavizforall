# Transform Your Map Data
*by [Jack Dougherty, Stacy Lam, and David Tatem](../introduction/who.md), last updated March 26, 2017*

Interactive web maps are made up of different layers, such as background basemaps, colored or shaded polygons, and/or colored point markers. This chapter describes how to transform your data into layers that you can upload into online map tools and templates. Specifically, you will learn how to:

- Pivot address-level point data into polygon data
- Normalize data to create more meaningful polygon maps
- Convert map data with GeoJSON.io or Mapshaper.org
- Join spreadsheets and polygon boundaries with MapShaper.org
- Upload your polygon data into Leaflet Maps with Google Sheets template
- Pull live open data into Leaflet map with API endpoint
