# Transform Your Data Tables

This section demonstrates ways to restructure your spreadsheet data and make it more meaningful for your data visualization. For example, you may wish to:

- Aggregate (or group together) rows of data with similar entries
- Join (or merge) data from two tables that share a similar column
- Geocode (or locate the map coordinates) of street address data

**TO DO**
- Clean up data that contains stray commas, or mistyped entries
- Advanced clean up with Open Refine; see Alvin Chang's CT Mirror guide http://trendct.org/2015/04/24/john-jonathan-and-johnny-how-to-merge-them-in-open-refine/
