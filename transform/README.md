# Transform Your Map Data
*by [Jack Dougherty, Stacy Lam, and David Tatem](../introduction/who.md), last updated March 30, 2017*

Interactive web maps are made up of different layers, such as background basemaps, colored or shaded polygons, and/or colored point markers. This chapter describes how to transform your data into layers that you can upload into online map tools and templates. Specifically, you will learn how to:
- [Geocode locations into coordinates with US Census or Google](geocode)
- [Pivot address-level point data into polygon data](pivot)
- [Normalize data to create more meaningful polygon maps](normalize)
- [Convert map data](convert-geojson) with [GeoJSON.io](geojsonio) or [Mapshaper.org](mapshaper)
- [Join spreadsheets and polygon boundaries with MapShaper.org](mapshaper)
- [Upload GeoJSON Data to a Leaflet Map template on GitHub](upload)
- [Pull open repository data into a Leaflet map with APIs](open-data-api)

**[Enroll in our free online course](../../enroll)**, which introduces these topics in the brief video below, and offers more exercises and opportunities to interact with instructors and other learners.
