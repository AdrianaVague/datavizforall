How to read Leaflet map code templates in this book

Templates vary from simple to complex, but all of them operate with three common types of code:
- HTML: to structure its content on the web (example: index.html)
- CSS: the Cascading Style Sheet to shape its appearance on the web (example: style.css)
- JavaScript: to create and interact with the data visualization (example: script.js)

In addition, many of these templates include:
- data: the content of the visualization, which varies widely (examples: data.csv, data.geojson, or a remote Google Fusion Table)
- library: a link to an online code to perform a task (examples: jQuery, Leaflet)
- basemaps: a link to an online background map (examples: Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, CartoDB)
