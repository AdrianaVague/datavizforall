# Detect Bias in Data Stories
*by [Jack Dougherty, Stacy Lam, and David Tatem](../introduction/who.md), last updated March 17, 2017*

While we like to believe data visualizations simply "tell the truth," when you dig further into this topic, you realize that there are multiple ways to represent reality. In this chapter, you will learn how visualizations display the biases of the people and the software that create them. Although we cannot stop bias, we can teach people to look for and detect it, and be aware of our own.

Sections in this chapter:
- [How to Lie with Charts](how-to-lie-with-charts), inspired by Darrell Huff (1954)
- [How to Lie with Maps](how-to-lie-with-maps), inspired by Mark Monmonier (1996)
