*by [Jack Dougherty, Stacy Lam, and David Tatem](../introduction/who.md), last updated March 5, 2017*

Maps can entice readers to explore your data story and develop a stronger sense of place. But good maps require careful thought about how to communicate insights to your audience. This chapter features design principles and free tools to create interactive maps that you can embed in your website.

## Create a meaningful interactive map
1) [Draw and write your data story](../../choose/draw) as shown in a previous chapter. What questions do you want to explore, or insights that you want to explain? Sketch a simple picture and write down main ideas to capture your vision on paper.
2) Practice [principles of good map design](design) in this chapter. Learn to identify good maps from bad ones.
3) Choose a map type that matches your story and data format in the table below. Follow tutorial links to *easy tools* for beginners or *power tools* that require you to [Share, Edit, and Host Code Templates with GitHub](../github). Refer to [Spreadsheet Skills](../spreadsheet) and [Clean Your Data](../clean) chapters in this book if needed.
4) Learn how to [embed your interactive map in your website](../embed) in this book.
5) Focus on [storytelling](../storytelling) to accompany your visualization. Write compelling titles and text to call attention to the most meaningful insights in your map, and explain any data limitations.
