# Map Your Data

When thinking about mapping your data, ask yourself these questions:

1. Is a map the best way to tell the story behind this data?
- **TO DO**: Insert example of longitudinal place data expressed as line chart, not map

2. Does my data contain spatial information, such as the following?
- street addresses (example: 100 Main St, Hartford, CT, 06106)
- latitude/longitude coordinates (example: 41.756, -72.675)
- a data column that refers to locations (examples: Town: Hartford, or Zip: 06106)

If your data tables lacks spatial information, it may not be possible to map it.

3. What type of map is the best fit for my spatial data and story?
- Point map: best for specific location data (such as addresses or geocoordinates)
- Polygon map: best for boundary area data (such as census tracts, towns, states)

**To Do** Refer to other types of maps and data, such as heat maps, line maps, etc.
