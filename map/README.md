# Map Your Data

** TO DO **
- fill out table with map types and tutorial links

Maps can entice readers to explore your data story and develop a stronger sense of place. But good maps require careful thought about how to communicate insights to your audience. This chapter features design principles and free tools to create interactive maps that you can embed in your website. Before leaping into a data mapping project, ask yourself these questions:

## Ask Before You Map

#### A) Does your data contain geographic information?
Here's some examples:
- street addresses (example: 100 Main St, Hartford, CT, 06106)
- latitude/longitude coordinates (example: 41.756, -72.675)
- a data column (examples: Nation, or State, or Zip code) that includes specific locations (examples: USA, or Connecticut, or 06106)

While there are many more types of geographic information, the examples above are the most common. But if your data lacks geographic or spatial information, it may be impossible (or may not be feasible) to map it.

#### B) Does location really matter to your data story?
Sometimes the best way to visualize your story may be with a chart, instead of a map. Examples:
- a scatter chart may be the best way to show the relationship between two or more datasets across different locations
- a line chart may be the best way to show change over time in different places, such as population change
- links to visuals to come **

#### C) If a map is the best way to tell your data story
then follow these steps to create a meaningful interactive map:

1) [Draw and write your data story](../../choose/draw) as shown in a previous chapter. What questions do you want to explore, or insights that you want to explain? Sketch a simple picture and write down main ideas to capture your vision on paper.
2) Learn [Map design principles](design) and the [ColorBrewer tool](colorbrewer) in this chapter. Identify what makes a good map versus a bad one.
3) Choose the **map type** that matches your story and data format in the table below. Follow tutorial links to *easy tools* for beginners or *power tools* that require you to [Modify and Host Code Templates with GitHub](../github). Refer to [Spreadsheet Skills](../spreadsheet) and [Clean Your Data](../clean) chapters in this book if needed.
4) Learn how to [embed your interactive map in your website](../embed) in this book.
5) [Tell your data story](../story) to accompany your visualization. Write compelling titles and text to call attention to the most meaningful insights in your map, and explain any data limitations.

** TO DO **
- point maps (with colored markers to show specific locations)
- polygon maps (with colored areas to show values for regions)
- Point map: best for specific location data (such as addresses or geocoordinates)
- Polygon map: best for boundary area data (such as census tracts, towns, states)
- point map best for showing data about specific locations (addresses, lat/long coords)
	- show example of a point data table
- polygon maps best for showing data about geographic regions (nations, states, neighborhoods, etc)
	- show example of a polygon data table
- Refer to other types of maps and data, such as story maps, heat maps, etc.
