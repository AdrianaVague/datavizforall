# Quickly Create a Geocoded Point Map with BatchGeo

*By [Jack Dougherty](../../introduction/who.md), last updated March 17, 2016*

The free version of the BatchGeo mapping tool (http://batchgeo.com) is so quick and easy that it barely needs a tutorial.

- Copy and paste (or drag and drop) address data into the tool.
- Click the Validate & Set Options button to check, or the Map Now button.
- BatchGeo will try to geocode your address data, and display your map.
- Click the Save and Continue button. Your email is required.
- BatchGeo emails you a link to edit the map, or embed it in your website.

Pros:
- A very quick and easy mapping tool for new learners
- Automatically recognizes and inserts color markers for textual data categories, such as "type" for each location

Cons (unless you pay for the expensive pro license):
- Upload only 250 rows of data
- Limited map editing tools
- Must manually disable advertisements
- Cannot overlay your point map with other maps
