# Edit Open-Source Code Templates and Host on the Web

This section demonstrates how to edit free and open-source templates of data visualization code and host them on the web. This book does not attempt to teach coding from scratch. However, by learning some basic principles and tools, you can easily change a few lines of code and insert your own data into an existing template to make it your own.

The easy-to-modify data visualization templates in this book contain code that is hosted on a website and runs inside the user's web browser.

While there are multiple ways to host code, this book demonstrates GitHub (a free web tool to display and share code) and GitHub Pages (to host basic code on a live website).

Templates vary from simple to complex, but all of them operate with three common types of code:
- HTML: to structure its content on the web (example: index.html)
- CSS: the Cascading Style Sheet to shape its appearance on the web (example: style.css)
- JavaScript: to create and interact with the data visualization (example: script.js)

In addition, many of these templates include:
- data: the content of the visualization, which varies widely (examples: data.csv, data.geojson, or a remote Google Fusion Table)
- library: a link to an online code to perform a task (examples: jQuery, Leaflet)
- basemaps: a link to an online background map (examples: Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, CartoDB)
