# Public or Private Data?

Some of the free web-based data visualization tools featured in this book require you to make your information publicly available. Check each tool carefully and decide whether it is appropriate for public or private data.

Be careful not to share private data that you are responsible for keeping confidential, such as individual-level health records or student records. In some cases, individual-level private data may be publicly shared if it is aggregated (sorted into larger groups) and anonymized (with individual-level details removed).
