# Improve Your Spreadsheet Skills

**TO DO** expand this section

Spreadsheets are wonderful tools to organize data into tables of rows and columns. This chapter introduces some of the basic skills in working with spreadsheet tools, including these very popular ones:

**TO DO** revise into a table



Although there are differences between these tools, this book will focus on basic tasks that are nearly the same across all three.

Of course, there are more complex tools to manage large databases (or collections of tables with relationships between them). In this introductory book, we'll focus on simpler spreadsheet tools.

This section demonstrates ways to restructure your spreadsheet data and make it more meaningful for your data visualization. For example, you may wish to:

- Aggregate (or group together) rows of data with similar entries
- Join (or merge) data from two tables that share a similar column

**TO DO**
- Clean up data that contains stray commas, or mistyped entries
- Advanced clean up with Open Refine; see Alvin Chang's CT Mirror guide http://trendct.org/2015/04/24/john-jonathan-and-johnny-how-to-merge-them-in-open-refine/


What’s the best way to store and share data for your project?

If only one person is working on a data table, then any spreadsheet tool is fine (such as Excel).

If multiple people need read-only access to a table, then use a tool to store your spreadsheet online, such as:
- Use Google Sheets (see below)
- OR, If you prefer to keep the file in Excel format:
Set up a free Dropbox.com account
Upload the Excel file to your Dropbox online
Use Dropbox commands to “Share a Dropbox link” with other people


If multiple people need simultaneous editing access to the table (for example, if both you and Mike need to clean up the data, working at the same time), then use a shareable spreadsheet tool, such as Google Sheets.
Open Google Drive
Upload an existing table (in Excel or CSV or other formats)
Google will convert the table in Google Sheets format
Change Share settings > Advanced > Anyone with the link > Can Edit
