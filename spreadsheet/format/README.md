**TO DO** reorganize and emphasize the two title concepts, highlight Google Sheets, redo visuals; whenever possible, start text by posing a common data problem, and point out how the tool can help solve it

## Clean column headers and data cells

Across the top row, insert short meaningful headers for each column. Avoid special characters that may not be recognized properly by other applications.

Make the data in the column consistent within itself.

**TO DO** insert example of inconsistent data, then show uniform data

## Format columns for consistency

**TO DO ** revise to show example of an inconsistent column, and how reformatting makes consistent

If your data needs to be formatted, select a spreadsheet column by clicking at the top. Or select the entire spreadsheet by clicking the top-left corner icon. Right-click your selection to reformat data (or use menu commands). For example, reformat the data to change the number of decimal points displayed. Or reformat a zip code from a number (because 06106 will not display the first zero) into a text or zip code field.

## Sort data by columns

** TO DO ** redo this example

To sort data rows by a column, select the entire spreadsheet (top-left corner icon), then right-click or look for the sort menu. Be sure to select the entire sheet to avoid accidentally sorting one column without the adjacent ones.
