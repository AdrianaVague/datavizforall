Spreadsheets are wonderful tools to organize data into tables of rows and columns. This chapter introduces some of the basic skills in working with spreadsheet tools, including these very popular ones:

**TO DO** revise into a table

- [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/): free spreadsheet tool on the Google Drive platform, works in modern browsers, requires free account.
- Microsoft Excel: many people are familiar with this tool, which also has advanced features, but it is not free
- [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/): a powerful open-source alternative to Microsoft Office, which anyone can [freely download](http://www.libreoffice.org/download) for Mac/Windows/Linux, with donation requested

Although there are differences between these tools, this book will focus on basic tasks that are nearly the same across all three.

Of course, there are more complex tools to manage large databases (or collections of tables with relationships between them). In this introductory book, we'll focus on simpler spreadsheet tools.

## Clean column headers and data cells

Across the top row, insert short meaningful headers for each column. Avoid special characters that may not be recognized properly by other applications.

Make the data in the column consistent within itself.

**TO DO** insert example of inconsistent data, then show uniform data

## Format columns for consistency

**TO DO ** revise to show example of an inconsistent column, and how reformatting makes consistent

If your data needs to be formatted, select a spreadsheet column by clicking at the top. Or select the entire spreadsheet by clicking the top-left corner icon. Right-click your selection to reformat data (or use menu commands). For example, reformat the data to change the number of decimal points displayed. Or reformat a zip code from a number (because 06106 will not display the first zero) into a text or zip code field.

## Sort data by columns

** TO DO ** redo this example

To sort data rows by a column, select the entire spreadsheet (top-left corner icon), then right-click or look for the sort menu. Be sure to select the entire sheet to avoid accidentally sorting one column without the adjacent ones.
