# Rate Three Simple Map Tools
*by [Jack Dougherty, Stacy Lam, and David Tatem](../../introduction/who.md), last updated February 5, 2017*

Let's test some criteria from the previous chapter by comparing three different tools, and reflecting on which factors are most important to you. Below are three drag-and-drop tools to transform a spreadsheet of address data into a simple interactive point map. Each tool can **geocode** address data by looking up a location (such as 500 Main Street, Hartford CT) in a large database, deciding on the best match, and converting this data into latitude and longitude coordinates (such as 41.762, -72.674).

| Tool |  Step-by-step tutorial in this book |
| :---- | :---- |
| [BatchGeo](http://batchgeo.com) | [BatchGeo tutorial](../../map/batchgeo/) |
| [Google My Maps](http://google.com/mymaps) | [My Maps tutorial](../../map/mymaps/) |
| [Carto Builder](http://carto.com) | [Carto tutorial](../../map/carto/) |

Use each tool to build a map using the sample address data below. This simple spreadsheet lists 9 locations in North America, with 3 intentional mistakes to test for geocoding errors. Click the link to view the Google Sheet in your browser, then select File > Download as > CSV (comma-separated values), a generic table format that easily uploads into most data visualization tools.

- Right-click the link above to open the Google Sheet in a new browser tab
- File > Download As > Comma-separated values (CSV) to save to your computer

Hint: If the Google Sheet link above is not accessible, then right-click > Save As this [sample address data link](../sample-address-data-for-point-maps.csv) to download the same file in CSV format.

After following the three tutorials to build a point map with the same data, rate each tool (Batch Geo, My Maps, and Carto) on these selected criteria:
- Easy-to-learn: Which tool was the simplest for creating a basic point map?
- Price: Which of these free tools provided the most services at no cost?
- Customization: Which tool enabled you to modify the most details about your map?
- Data Migration: Which tool most easily allowed you to import and export your data?
- Error-friendly: Which tool geocoded most accurately or signaled possible errors?
