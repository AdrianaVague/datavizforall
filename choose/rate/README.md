# Rate Three Simple Map Tools
*by [Jack Dougherty, Stacy Lam, and David Tatem](../../introduction/who.md), last updated February 10, 2017*

Let's explore criteria from the previous chapter by comparing three different tools, and reflecting on which factors you feel are most important when making decisions about your toolkit. We'll test three drag-and-drop tools to transform sample address data into a simple interactive point map.

Each tool can **geocode** address data by looking up a location (such as 500 Main Street, Hartford CT) in a large database, deciding on the best match, and converting this data into latitude and longitude coordinates (such as 41.762, -72.674).

For our sample data, we'll use this table of 9 locations in North America, with 3 intentional mistakes to test for geocoding errors.

First, download the sample data. Right-click > Save As this [sample address data in CSV format](sample-address-data.csv), a general spreadsheet file format, and download it to your computer. If you need help, see this [short video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-04PQldP9HQ) on how to download and upload data.

Next, build a point map with the sample data, by following the tutorials for the three tools below.

| Tool |  Step-by-step tutorial in this book |
| :---- | :---- |
| [BatchGeo](http://batchgeo.com) | [BatchGeo tutorial](../../map/batchgeo/) |
| [Google My Maps](http://google.com/mymaps) | [My Maps tutorial](../../map/mymaps/) |
| [Carto Builder](http://carto.com) | [Carto tutorial](../../map/carto/) |

Finally, rate your experience using each tool with these selected criteria:
- Easy-to-learn: Which tool was the simplest for creating a basic point map?
- Price: Which of these free tools provided the most services at no cost?
- Customization: Which tool enabled you to modify the most details about your map?
- Data Migration: Which tool most easily allowed you to import and export your data?
- Error-friendly: Which tool geocoded most accurately or signaled possible errors?
