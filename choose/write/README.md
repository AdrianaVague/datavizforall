## Write and Draw your Data Story

Don't forget the most important part of your toolkit: your *story*. Remember that the primary reason we're designing visualizations is to improve how we communicate our data story. 

Push away the computer and pick up some old-school tools:
  - colored markers or pencils
  - lots of blank paper
  - your imagination

First, at the top of the page, write down your data story.
- Is it in the form of a question? If so, figure out how to pose the question.
- Or maybe it's in the form of an answer to that question? If so, spell out your clearest statement.
- If you're lucky, perhaps you already can envision a full story, with a beginning, middle, and end.
- Whatever form it takes in your head, write out the words that come to mind.

Further down the page (or on a separate sheet), draw pictures of the visualizations that come to mind, even if you don't yet have any data. No artistic skills or data points are necessary. Just use your imagination.
- Do you envision some type of chart? Sketch out your thoughts.
- Or do you imagine some type of map? Draw a picture of what's on your mind.
- Might there be interactive features? Insert buttons or menus.

Finally, share your preliminary data story with another person. Even if it's just a sentence and a quick sketch, does it help to convey the broader idea that you're trying to communicate? Does the picture add a new dimension to the text? If so, this is one good sign that your data story is worth pursuing, with the visualization tools, templates, and techniques in the chapters of this book.
