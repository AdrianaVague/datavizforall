# Simplify and Edit with MapShaper.org

MapShaper (http://MapShaper.org) is another versatile open-source mapping tool, developed and maintained by [Matthew Bloch on GitHub](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper). Using the web interface, users can:
- upload map boundaries in various formats: shapefile (.shp), GeoJSON, CSV, and more
- simplify (or smooth out) geographic details to reduce file size
- edit geographic features (dissolve boundaries, etc.)
- export map boundaries the same formats as above

This free and easy-to-learn MapShaper.org web tool has replaced *many* of my map preparation tasks that previously required expensive and hard-to-learn ArcGIS software, or its free but still-challenging-to-learn cousin, QGIS. Even advanced GIS users may find MapShaper.org to be a quick alternative for some, but not all, tasks.
