# Convert a Compressed KMZ file to KML format

Sometimes KML files are distributed in compressed KMZ format. One easy conversion method:

- Install the free [Google Earth tool](https://www.google.com/earth/)
- Double-click on any .kmz file to open it in Google Earth
- Right-click (or control-click) on the .kmz layer and select Save As
