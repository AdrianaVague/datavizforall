This free six-week course is ideal for non-profit organizations, small business owners, local governments, journalists, academics, or anyone who wants to tell their story and show the data.

We’ll begin with easy-to-learn tools, then gradually work our way up to editing open-source code templates with GitHub. Together, we’ll follow step-by-step tutorials with video screencasts, and share our work for feedback on the web. Real-world examples are drawn from Trinity College students working with community organizations in the City of Hartford, Connecticut.

## What you’ll learn:
- Choose the right tools to tell your story
- Design and embed charts on your website
- Find and transform your data tables
- Share, edit, and host code templates
- How to build (and tell lies with) maps
- Convert and reshape your spatial data
- Tell your story and show it with data

Tutorials will feature tools such as Google Sheets, Tableau Public, HighCharts, Socrata, Carto, Leaflet, and GitHub.
