This free six-week course is ideal for non-profit organizations, small business owners, local governments, journalists, academics, or anyone who wants to tell their story and show the data.

We’ll begin with easy-to-learn tools, then gradually work our way up to editing open-source code templates. Together, we’ll follow step-by-step tutorials with video screencasts, and share our work for feedback on the web. Real-world examples are drawn from Trinity College students working with community organizations in the City of Hartford, Connecticut.

## What you’ll learn:
- Design visualizations to tell your story with data
- Choose the right tools for the task
- Find and transform data with Google Sheets and MapShaper
- Edit open-source code templates with GitHub
- Create and embed interactive charts with Tableau Public and HighCharts
- Build point and polygon maps with Carto and Leaflet
