# Embed with iFrame on WordPress.org

*Last updated by [Jack Dougherty](introduction/who.md) on February 11, 2016*

**TO DO: revise this opening**

To embed one web page (the data visualization) inside a second web page (the organization's website), we use a simple HTML code known as **iframe**. (Read more about the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.asp" target="_blank">ifram</a><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.asp" target="_blank">e tag at W3Schools</a>.)

The **general iframe concept** works across many data visualization tools and many websites:
- Copy the embed code or URL from your dataviz website
- Paste (and modify) the code as an iframe in your destination website

To embed your dataviz in a self-hosted Wordpress.org site, the [iframe plugin] (http://wordpress.org/plugins/iframe/) must be installed and activated. This plugin allows authors to embed iframe codes inside posts/pages, in a modified "shortcode" format surrounded by square brackets. Without the plugin, self-hosted WordPress.org sites will usually "strip out" iframe codes for all users except the site administrator. **I have already installed and activated** the iframe plugin on my site, and the Dashboard view looks like this:

Note that most WordPress.com sites do NOT support an iframe embed code.

But details vary, so read and experiment with the examples that follow.
