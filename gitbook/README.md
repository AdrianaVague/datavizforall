# About This GitBook

***Data Visualization for All*** is created with [GitBook](http://gitbook.com), an open-source publishing platform that creates multiple editions (Web, PDF, ePUB, Mobi/Kindle), written in the easy-to-read Markdown format. See GitBook documentation (which is still a work-in-progress) in two places:
- https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook#gitbook
- https://help.gitbook.com

This book is hosted on the free GitBook.com platform. Updates are automatically generated when the author makes changes to the master branch of its linked GitHub repository: https://github.com/JackDougherty/datavizbook
