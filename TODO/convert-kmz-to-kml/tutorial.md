To create a <a href="http://epress.trincoll.edu/dataviz/chapter/create-thematic-polygon-map/" target="_blank">thematic polygon data map</a> in Google Fusion Tables, you need boundary data, which you may find in public geographic repositories on the web. In Connecticut, look at <a href="http://magic.lib.uconn.edu" target="_blank">MAGIC</a>, the Map and Geographic Information Center at the University of Connecticut Libraries. This tutorial illustrates how to download the <a href="http://magic.lib.uconn.edu/connecticut_data.html#census" target="_blank">statewide 2010 Census Tract boundary file</a>, and use free and easy tools to convert and filter a select area to use in a Google Fusion Tables polygon map. (If you cannot find appropriate geographic boundary data online, another option is to ask someone with more sophisticated ArcGIS or QGIS software to create the file for you.)

On the MAGIC website above, the Connecticut Tracts file appears in the KML (Keyhole Markup Language) column. However, if you download the file, you will initially appear in a compressed KMZ format, and must be converted to KML for use in Google Fusion Tables.

To convert from compressed KMZ to regular KML, download the free Google Earth application and use it to open the KMZ file. Right-click on the desired layer in the Places window, then Save Places As in KML format, which can be uploaded to Google Fusion Tables.

In this example, you can save the entire state boundary — or selected census tracts — in KML format. But the result will always include the full original file (over 7 megabytes), which may so large that it slows down your interactive web map.

To extract a small number of census tracts from the statewide file, use Google Fusion Tables filter feature. Upload the full KML file to Google Fusion Tables and view in the Map tab. Then use the Filter menu to select a subset of census tracts by name (in this example, West Hartford tracts are named by number, from 4961 to 4977).

In the File menu, download the filtered rows only in KML format, which results in a much smaller file (in this example, 78 kb).
