# Highcharts Code Templates

** TO DO **
- introduce why and when to use Highcharts code libraries
- list pros and cons from resources such as https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/adding-charts-to-your-site-with-highcharts--cms-21692 and https://www.slant.co/versus/11578/11579/~google-charts_vs_highcharts
- describe more powerful statistical analysis tools (such as R) and more powerful data visualization code libraries (such as D3), but both are harder to learn, and this book focuses on the easiest tools to complete most common visualization tasks, to spend more energy on the storytelling.

Advantages:
- more control to customize and host data visualizations on any web server
- no usage fee for non-commercial use….see below
Disadvantage: dependent on Highcharts code library

Also, note that Highcharts is open-source code, and free for individual, school, and non-profit use.
If commercial use, then you’ll need to purchase a license
