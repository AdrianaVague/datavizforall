# Highcharts Code Templates

** to do **
- introduce why and when to use Highcharts code libraries
- list pros and cons from resources such as https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/adding-charts-to-your-site-with-highcharts--cms-21692 and https://www.slant.co/versus/11578/11579/~google-charts_vs_highcharts
- describe more powerful statistical analysis tools (such as R) and more powerful data visualization code libraries (such as D3), but both are harder to learn, and this book focuses on the easiest tools to complete most common visualization tasks, to spend more energy on the storytelling.
