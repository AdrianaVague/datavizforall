*By [Jack Dougherty](../../introduction/who.md), last updated February 12, 2017*

Use Google Sheets (http://sheets.google.com), an easy drag-and-drop tool, to create basic interactive charts that you can embed in your website.

## Tool Review
- Pros:
  - Free and easy-to-learn tool on the collaborative Google Drive platform.
  - Edit, share, and publish interactive charts from your data, all in one spreadsheet.
- Cons:
  - Limited control over chart appearance.
  - No automatic option to cite or link source data inside the chart.
  - Scatter charts do not correctly display data labels in tooltips.
  - Bubble charts cannot display uniformly small bubble sizes.
  - For more powerful tools that require more skills, see tutorials in this book on [Tableau Public](../scatter-chart-tableau/) and [Highcharts](../../highcharts/).
