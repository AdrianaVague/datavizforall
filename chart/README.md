# Chart Your Data

**TO DO** write a stronger introduction
- Charts are often the best way to visualize your data story.
- interactive charts on the web can pull readers deeper into your story, to explore and see the data in ways that are not possible on paper
- But good charts require thoughtful design about meaningful ways to communicate your data.

## Steps
- Start with your data story (link to earlier story chapter). Draw a simple picture and write sentences to capture your ideas on paper.
- Choose a chart type that matches your story and your data format. If necessary, go to the Spreadsheet Skills and Clean Your Data chapters to decide if you can reformat your data to match your desired chart type.
- For each chart type, follow the tutorial links to to *easy tools* for beginners or *power tools* that use code templates (see upcoming chapter...)
- Customize your chart using good design principles (link to chapter)
- Embed your interactive chart on your website (link to embed chapters)
- Tell your story and show the data. Write sentences, titles, and labels that call attention to the most meaningful insights in your chart, as well as any data limitations.
