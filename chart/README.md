# Chart Your Data
*by [Jack Dougherty](../introduction/who.md), last updated March 7, 2017*

Charts pull readers deeper into your story. Even if your data contains geographical information, sometimes a chart tells your story better than a map. But designing meaningful, interactive charts requires careful thought about how to communicate your data story with your audience. In this chapter, you will learn how to:
- Practice [principles of chart design](design). Learn to identify good charts from bad ones.
- Choose a chart type that matches your story and data format, and follow tutorials in the table below. Beginners may start with easy-to-learn tools such as [Google Sheets](google-sheets) or [Tableau Public](tableau-public), then move up to more powerful tools, such as [Highcharts](../highcharts), which require you to [Share, Edit, and Host Code Templates with GitHub](../github) or another web host.
