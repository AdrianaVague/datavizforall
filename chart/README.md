# Chart Your Data
*by [Jack Dougherty](../introduction/who.md), last updated February 23, 2017*

Charts can be a greater way to visualize your data and pull readers deeper into the story. Even if your data contains geographical information, in some cases a chart may tell your story better than a map. But good charts require careful thought about how to communicate insights to your audience. This chapter features design principles and tools to create interactive charts (rather than static images), which you can embed in your website.

## Create a meaningful interactive chart
1) [Draw and write your data story](../../choose/draw) as shown in a previous chapter. What questions do you want to explore, or insights that you want to explain? Sketch a simple picture and write down main ideas to capture your vision on paper.
2) Practice [principles of good chart design](design) in this chapter. Learn to identify good charts from bad ones.
3) Choose a chart type that matches your story and data format in the table below. Follow tutorial links to *easy tools* for beginners or *power tools* that require you to [Edit and Host code templates](../edit). Refer to [Spreadsheet Skills](../spreadsheet) and [Clean Your Data](../clean) chapters in this book if needed.
4) Learn how to [embed your interactive chart in your website](../embed) in this book.
5) Focus on [storytelling](../storytelling) to accompany your visualization. Write compelling titles, labels, and sentences that call attention to the most meaningful insights in your chart, and explain any data limitations.

| Basic chart types | Best use and tutorial chapters |
| --- | --- |

| Separated Column and Bar<br> ![](chart-placeholder.png) | Best to compare categories in separate clusters. Vertical columns, or horizontal bars for long labels.<br>Easy tool: [Google Sheets bar and column tutorial](column-bar-google)<br>Power tool: [Highcharts templates](../highcharts/) |
| Stacked Column and Bar<br> ![](chart-placeholder.png) | Best to compare sub-categories, or parts of a whole. Vertical columns, or horizontal bars for long labels.<br>Easy tool: [Google Sheets bar and column tutorial](column-bar-google)<br>Power tool: [Highcharts templates](../highcharts/) |
| Histograms<br> ![](chart-placeholder.png) | Best to show distribution of raw data, with number of values in each bucket.<br>Easy tool: [Google Sheets bar and column tutorial](column-bar-google)<br>Power tool: [Highcharts templates](../highcharts/) |
| Pie chart<br> ![](chart-placeholder.png) | Best to show parts of a whole, but hard to estimate size of slices.<br>Easy tool: [Google Sheets pie chart tutorial](pie-line-area-google)<br>Power tool: [Highcharts templates](../highcharts/) |
