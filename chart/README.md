# Chart Your Data
*by [Jack Dougherty](../introduction/who.md), last updated February 20, 2017*

Charts are often the best way to visualize your data and pull readers deeper into the story. Even if your data contains geographical information, in some cases a chart tells your story better than a map. But well-designed charts require careful thought about how to communicate meaningful insights to your audience. This chapter features tools to create interactive charts (rather than static images) that you can embed in your website.

## Recommended steps
1) [Draw and write your data story](../../choose/draw) as shown in a previous chapter. What are key insights that you want to explore or explain? Sketch a simple picture and write out the main ideas to capture your vision on paper.
2) Practice the [principles of good chart design chart](design) as described in this chapter. Learn to identify good charts from bad ones.
3) Choose a chart type that matches your story and data format, in the table below. For each type, follow tutorial links to *easy tools* for beginners or *power tools* that require code templates. If necessary, see the [Spreadsheet Skills](../spreadsheet) and [Clean Your Data](../clean) chapters in this book to reformat your data to match your desired chart type.
4) [Embed your interactive chart in your website](../embed), as shown in an upcoming chapter.
- Embed your interactive chart on your website (link to embed chapters)
5) Focus on [storytelling](../storytelling) to accompany your visualization. Write sentences, titles, and labels that call attention to the most meaningful insights in your chart, as well as any data limitations.
