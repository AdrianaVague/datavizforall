# Chart Your Data

**TO DO** write a stronger introduction
- Charts are often the best way to visualize your data story.
- interactive charts on the web can pull readers deeper into your story, to explore and see the data in ways that are not possible on paper
- But good charts require thoughtful design about meaningful ways to communicate your data.

## Steps
- Start with your data story (link to earlier story chapter). Draw a simple picture and write sentences to capture your ideas on paper. Learn about principles of good chart design (link to design chapter).
- Choose a chart type that best fits your story, and format your data to match it. See images and links below to *easy tools* for beginners as well as *power tools* using code templates.
- Embed the interactive chart on your website (link to embed chapters)
- Tell your story. Write titles and sentences to call attention to the most meaningful insights (and limitations) in your data.
